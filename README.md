RoboCup@Home VizBox
===================

The RoboCup@Home VizBox is a little webserver @Home robots can run to vizualize what is going on. 

The main page shows
- an outline of the current challenge and where the robot is in the story of that challenge. 
- Subtitles of what the robot and operator just said; their conversation
- Images of what the robot sees or a visualisation of the robot's world model, eg. camera images, it's map, anything to make clear what is going on to the audience.
